# DroneBlocks Tello Camera Access with Python, OpenCV, Flask

A Python based project that allows users to manually control Tello, access the camera, and program Tello with DroneBlocks. Check out the course that walks through the details of installing dependencies and using the app:

https://learn.droneblocks.io/p/opencv-python-and-droneblocks-for-tello-camera-control/

**Please note that this project has only been tested on Windows 10 and Mac OS X**

This project was developed by the DroneBlocks team to provide the following capabilities:

1. Navigate Tello using brower based controls
2. Navigate Tello using the keyboard: wasd for left stick control and up/down/left/right arrows for right stick control
3. Access Tello's camera to take photos and record video
4. DroneBlocks for block-based programming and autonomous flight
5. Basic introduction to computer vision with ArUco markers
6. Joystick control coming soon
